# Demo Images

For the Astro v3.1.0 page, you'll need to place the following image in this directory:

- `astro-v3-demo-thumbnail.png` - A high-quality screenshot or thumbnail image showing the Astro interface with the new v3.1.0 features such as the ModelA 8-Pro model, Canvas editing feature, or conversation modes.

Recommended image specifications:
- Resolution: 1280x720 pixels (16:9 aspect ratio)
- Format: JPG or PNG
- File size: Optimized for web (under 300KB recommended)

Until you add this image, the demo section will show a placeholder. You can replace it with an actual demo video by updating the YouTube embed URL in the `script.js` file.
